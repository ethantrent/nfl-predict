NFL 2025 Season Prediction Model

1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a prediction model to analyze NFL game data from the 2025 season using Python. The model will focus on answering two primary questions regarding team performance, using statistical analysis and predictive modeling. The project will use publicly available datasets from nflverse, accessed through nflreadpy to analyze historical and current season data. The insights gathered will be used to predict game outcomes and analyze key metrics such as betting spread and team efficiency.
2. Requirements
Core Questions (to be answered with the analysis):
Which teams are more likely to cover the spread in the 2025 season?


Use betting data (point spread, game results) to analyze home underdogs vs. home favorites.


Requirements:


Filter games based on home team, away team, and betting line.


Aggregate by season and compute cover rates for home underdogs vs. favorites.


Calculate and compare the cover rates.


Which offensive stats (e.g., passing efficiency, rushing yards) correlate best with wins in 2025?


Use team performance stats (e.g., passing and rushing efficiency) and correlate them with game outcomes (win/loss).


Requirements:


Aggregate data to the team-game level (pass EPA, rush EPA, etc.).


Merge performance data with game outcomes.


Calculate correlations and analyze which metrics predict wins most accurately.


Stretch Challenges:
Graphing: Create visualizations that display cover rates by season and the correlation between offensive efficiency and win probability.


Additional Question: Analyze if Thursday games have lower total scores than Sunday games.


Machine Learning Extension: Implement a machine learning model (logistic regression, random forest) to predict game outcomes based on team statistics (passing and rushing efficiency).



3. Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages:
Python (primary language)


Libraries:


pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.


matplotlib / seaborn: For data visualization (line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps).


nflreadpy: Python API for accessing NFL data (betting lines, play-by-play, team stats).


scikit-learn: For machine learning models like logistic regression or random forest.


Data Sources:
nflverse: Publicly available data via nflreadpy (game schedules, play-by-play, betting lines, team statistics).


Data for the 2025 season will be loaded using load_schedules(), load_betting_lines(), and load_pbp() functions.


Development Environment:
Python environment with packages installed via pip:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nflreadpy


IDE/Code Editor:
VSCode or Jupyter Notebook for writing and running Python code.


Version Control:
Git for version control and collaboration.


Use GitHub or GitLab to host the repository and track project progress.



4. Functional Requirements
Data Loading:


Load NFL data for the 2025 season using nflreadpy's functions.


Import game schedule, betting lines, and play-by-play data.


Filter data for the required season(s).


Data Analysis:


Home Underdogs vs Home Favorites:


Filter games based on whether the home team is an underdog or favorite.


Calculate the “cover” (if the home team wins by more than the point spread).


Aggregate the cover rate by season and compare home underdogs vs. favorites.


Correlating Offensive Efficiency with Wins:


Aggregate team-level statistics (e.g., pass EPA, rush EPA) by game.


Merge these statistics with game results (win/loss).


Calculate correlations between offensive stats and winning teams.


Predictive Model (optional for Stretch Challenge):


Implement a logistic regression model to predict the outcome of a game (win/loss).


Use features such as passing and rushing efficiency, home field advantage, and spread.


Train the model with a train-test split and evaluate the model’s accuracy.


Visualization:


Create visualizations to represent the cover rate of home favorites vs. underdogs across seasons.


Display correlation between offensive stats (passing/rushing) and game outcome (win/loss).


Create a heatmap of the correlation between different performance metrics.



5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:


The solution must load and analyze large datasets (spanning multiple seasons).


Visualization of trends (e.g., cover rates, correlations) must be fast and responsive.


Usability:


Code should be modular and reusable, with functions for loading data, analyzing it, and generating plots.


Clear documentation and comments to explain key steps in the code.


Graphs and charts should be easy to interpret.


Scalability:


The solution should be easily extendable to handle future seasons or additional datasets (e.g., player-level stats).



6. Deliverables
Code:


Python code implementing the analysis and predictive model.


Jupyter Notebook or Python script demonstrating the steps from data import to analysis and visualization.


Reports:


A brief report summarizing the analysis, key findings, and any challenges encountered during the project.


Include insights from the two main questions: home underdog cover rates and the impact of offensive efficiency on game outcomes.


Visualization:


A set of visualizations (e.g., line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) that help convey the analysis.


README:


A README file that includes:


Project overview and objectives


Setup instructions (for running the code)


Detailed explanations of the methods used in the analysis


Results and interpretations


How to extend the project (e.g., for additional seasons, questions)



7. Timeline
Week 1:


Data gathering and understanding (load data, inspect dataset).


Define and implement the first two questions: home underdogs vs. favorites, correlation of offensive stats with wins.


Week 2:


Implement visualizations and conduct analysis.


Start working on the optional predictive model and fine-tune analysis.


Week 3:


Finalize the report and visualizations.


Write up the README and ensure the project is properly documented.


Push the code to GitHub/GitLab and prepare the final submission.



8. Acceptance Criteria
The solution must load 2025 season data correctly from nflreadpy.


The analysis must provide answers to the two main questions with supporting calculations.


All plots and visualizations must be clear, accurate, and interpretable.


The README file must clearly explain how to run the code and what the outputs represent.


The machine learning model (if implemented) must be trained and evaluated correctly, with an accuracy score provided.



9. Risk Management
Data Availability: If any data for the 2025 season is unavailable, make sure to have a fallback plan (e.g., using earlier season data or focusing on specific teams).


Model Overfitting: Ensure that the machine learning model is evaluated with a test set and avoids overfitting.
