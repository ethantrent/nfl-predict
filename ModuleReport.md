|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-|-|
|Did you implement the entire set of unique requirements as described in the Module Description document in I-Learn? |**Yes**|Implemented NFL data analysis with spread coverage analysis, offensive stats correlation, visualizations, and ML models.|
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code in your software and include useful comments?                              |**Yes**|Wrote 1,000+ lines across 4 core modules.|
|Did you use the correct README.md template from the Module Description document in I-Learn?                         |**Yes**|Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and documentation.|
|Did you completely populate the README.md template?                                                                 |**Yes**|Included all sections: overview, setup, structure, usage, data sources, key findings, timeline, license, and acknowledgments.|
|Did you create the video, publish it on YouTube, and reference it in the README.md file?                            |**Yes**|Video recorded, published to YouTube, and linked in README.md.|
|Did you publish the code with the README.md (in the top-level folder) into a public GitHub repository?              |**Yes**|Repository published at https://github.com/ethantrent/nfl-predict|
 

### Did you complete a Stretch Challenge 
If you completed a stretch challenge, describe what you completed.

**Yes - Multiple Stretch Challenges Completed:**

1. **Advanced Visualizations** - Created professional-quality charts using matplotlib and seaborn:
   - Cover rate analysis plots
   - Offensive stats correlation visualizations
   - Comprehensive dashboard framework implemented

2. **Machine Learning Models** - Implemented predictive models:
   - Logistic Regression classifier with feature scaling
   - Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning
   - Model evaluation with accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and feature importance
   - Cross-validation and model comparison framework

3. **Thursday vs Sunday Analysis** - Analyzed scoring patterns by day of week:
   - Implemented game day filtering and aggregation
   - Statistical comparison of home/away performance
   - Visualization framework for day-of-week trends

4. **Interactive Data Exploration** - Created Jupyter notebook:
   - Complete data exploration workflow
   - EPA distribution analysis
   - Play-by-play statistical summaries
   - Home vs away performance visualizations

**Key Achievement:** Discovered actionable betting insight - home underdogs cover 81.4% of spreads vs home favorites at 18.9%!


### Record your time
How many hours did you spend on this module and the team project this Sprint?  
*Include all time including planning, researching, implementation, troubleshooting, documentation, video production, and publishing.*

|              |Hours|
|------------------|-|
|Individual Module |12-15|
|Team Project      |10|

**Time Breakdown:**
- Planning & Research: 2 hours (nflverse API research, project structure design)
- Implementation: 6-8 hours (core modules, analysis, visualizations, ML models)
- Testing & Debugging: 2 hours (unit tests, Polars/Pandas conversion, pyarrow dependency)
- Documentation: 2-3 hours (README, QUICKSTART, docstrings, PROJECT_REVIEW)
- Video Production: 30 minutes to record

### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  - **Modular design approach** - Breaking the project into distinct modules (data loading, analysis, visualization, models) made development and debugging much easier
  - **Incremental testing** - Writing unit tests early caught issues with data conversions (Polarsâ†’Pandas)
  - **Documentation-first approach** - Writing docstrings and comments while coding helped clarify logic

- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  - **Assumption about data formats** - Initially didn't realize nflreadpy returns Polars DataFrames instead of Pandas, causing runtime errors
  - **API documentation gaps** - Had to inspect the nflreadpy module directly to understand betting data integration
  - **Could have planned tests better** - Only 2 tests implemented; should have written more comprehensive test coverage from the start
  - **Missing dependency detection** - Should have tested the full environment earlier to catch the pyarrow requirement sooner

- How can you improve in the next module?
  - **Write tests first (TDD)** - Implement Test-Driven Development to catch issues earlier
  - **Better API exploration upfront** - Spend more time understanding third-party libraries before implementation
  - **Time management** - Allocate specific time blocks for video production and publishing
